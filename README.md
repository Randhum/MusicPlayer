## Requirements

### Gentoo Linux Dependencies

Install the following packages using `emerge`:

```bash
# Core GTK / GStreamer (required for playback)
emerge -av \
  media-libs/gstreamer \
  media-libs/gst-plugins-base \
  media-libs/gst-plugins-good \
  media-libs/gst-plugins-bad \
  media-plugins/gst-plugins-alsa \
  media-plugins/gst-plugins-mpg123 \
  media-plugins/gst-plugins-faac \
  media-plugins/gst-plugins-bluez

# For FLAC support, ensure the 'flac' USE flag is enabled for gst-plugins-good:
# Check current flags: emerge -pv media-libs/gst-plugins-good
# Enable if needed: echo "media-libs/gst-plugins-good flac" >> /etc/portage/package.use
# Then reinstall: emerge -av media-libs/gst-plugins-good

# Audio stack
emerge -av media-libs/alsa-lib

# Bluetooth support
emerge -av net-wireless/bluez

# GStreamer BlueZ plugin (recommended for Bluetooth audio)
# This provides native GStreamer integration with BlueZ for A2DP audio streaming
# The application will automatically use this plugin if available
emerge -av media-plugins/gst-plugins-bluez

# Audio system (choose one or both)
# Note: GStreamer BlueZ plugin works independently, but these provide additional routing options
emerge -av media-video/pipewire     # recommended
# or
emerge -av media-sound/pulseaudio

# Python bindings / libraries
emerge -av dev-python/pygobject dev-python/mutagen dev-python/dbus-python

# Optional but recommended: extra format support and tools
emerge -av media-video/ffmpeg dev-util/gst-devtools
```

### Python Dependencies

Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Contents of `requirements.txt`:
```
PyGObject
mutagen
dbus-python
```

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install system dependencies (see above)
3. Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

Run the application:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Music Library

The player automatically scans `~/Music` and `~/Musik` directories for audio files. Supported formats include:
- MP3
- FLAC (with full metadata support and 24-bit bitstream decoding)
- OGG
- M4A/AAC
- WAV
- Any format supported by GStreamer

**Audio Quality:**
All audio is processed and output at professional quality:
- **24-bit PCM** (S24LE format) for maximum dynamic range
- **44.1 kHz sample rate** (CD quality standard)
- **Stereo (2-channel)** output
- Automatic format conversion and resampling ensures consistent quality regardless of source format
- FLAC files are decoded from their native bitstream format and processed at full quality

**Library Indexing:**
- The library index is automatically saved to `~/.config/musicplayer/library_index.json`
- On startup, the index is loaded from disk for instant access
- Only new or modified files are rescanned, making subsequent scans much faster
- The index tracks file modification times to detect changes

### Dockable Panels

The application uses a modular panel system. Each panel has a header with:
- **Title**: Shows the panel name
- **Detach Button**: Click to pop out the panel as a separate window

Panels:
- **Library**: Browse your music using the original folder structure from your Music directory
- **Playlist**: View and manage your current queue with touch-friendly list items
- **Now Playing**: Display album art and track metadata
- **Bluetooth**: Manage Bluetooth connections and Speaker Mode

Panels can be resized by dragging the dividers between them. Layout is saved automatically.

### Fractal Screensaver

Each panel can display an animated fractal background screensaver using the perfect-shuffle algorithm (based on [perfect-shuffle](https://github.com/xcontcom/perfect-shuffle)). 

**Features:**
- **Auto-activation**: Screensaver automatically activates after 30 seconds of inactivity
- **Manual toggle**: Click the fractal icon (🎨) in any panel header to toggle the screensaver
- **Animated fractals**: Fractals "flow" and evolve over time, creating living patterns
- **Activity detection**: Any mouse movement, keyboard input, or click automatically disables the screensaver
- **Text inversion**: Text automatically inverts (white with shadow on dark backgrounds) for optimal readability
- **Per-panel**: Each panel has its own independent timeout and fractal pattern
- **Random patterns**: Patterns are randomly generated when enabled, creating unique visual experiences

The screensaver creates beautiful, self-similar fractal patterns that fill the entire panel background. The fractals continuously morph and flow, creating a mesmerizing "living" effect while keeping all UI elements functional and readable. The screensaver automatically activates when you're not interacting with a panel, and immediately deactivates when you move your mouse or type.

### Adding Music to Playlist

From the Library panel:
- **Double-click** a track to replace playlist and play
- **Double-click** a folder to add all tracks in that folder (and subfolders) and play
- **Right-click** for context menu:
  - "Play Now" / "Play Folder" - Replace playlist and play
  - "Add to Playlist" / "Add Folder to Playlist" - Append without playing

From the Playlist panel:
- **Double-click** a track to play it
- **Right-click** for context menu:
  - "Play" - Play the selected track
  - "Remove" - Remove from playlist
  - "Move Up/Down" - Reorder tracks
  - "Clear Playlist" - Remove all tracks
  - "Save Playlist..." - Save as named playlist

### Bluetooth Speaker Mode

To use your computer as a Bluetooth speaker:

1. Click **"Enable Speaker Mode"** in the Bluetooth panel
2. Your computer becomes discoverable as "Music Player Speaker"
3. On your mobile device, scan for and pair with your computer
4. Connect and select your computer as the audio output
5. Audio from your phone will stream through your computer's speakers

**Requirements for Bluetooth audio:**
- BlueZ daemon running (`systemctl start bluetooth`)
- GStreamer BlueZ plugin (recommended): `media-plugins/gst-plugins-bluez`
  - Provides native GStreamer integration with BlueZ D-Bus for A2DP audio
  - Automatically handles audio routing when devices connect
- Alternative: PipeWire or PulseAudio for audio routing (if GStreamer BlueZ plugin not available)
- Bluetooth adapter that supports A2DP sink profile

**Bluetooth Implementation:**
- Uses BlueZ D-Bus API for device management (pairing, connection, discovery)
- **Standards-Compliant Implementation**: Fully compliant with BlueZ Agent1 interface specification
  - Proper D-Bus method signatures matching BlueZ specifications
  - Correct error handling with BlueZ-specific D-Bus exceptions
  - Proper agent registration and cleanup on shutdown
- **Pairing Confirmations**: Full support for modern Bluetooth pairing with passkey/PIN confirmations
  - Automatically handles passkey display and confirmation dialogs
  - Supports 6-digit passkey matching (Numeric Comparison pairing, 000000-999999)
  - Supports PIN code entry when required (4-16 digits, validated)
  - Shows authorization dialogs for device connections
  - Proper validation of all pairing inputs according to Bluetooth standards
- **Device Trust Management**: Automatically trusts devices after successful pairing
  - Trusted devices can reconnect automatically without user intervention
  - Follows Bluetooth security best practices
- **Connection State Management**: Robust handling of connection state transitions
  - Proper handling of pairing, connection, and disconnection states
  - Signal-based property change monitoring
  - Clean resource management and cleanup
- **A2DP Sink Profile**: Verifies A2DP sink profile availability before enabling
  - Prefers GStreamer BlueZ plugin for audio streaming when available
  - Falls back to PipeWire/PulseAudio routing if GStreamer plugin not installed
  - All Bluetooth operations use the official BlueZ library via D-Bus

## Troubleshooting

### No sound output
1. Check that GStreamer ALSA plugin is installed: `gst-inspect-1.0 alsasink`
2. Verify ALSA is working: `aplay -l`
3. Check GStreamer can play audio: `gst-launch-1.0 audiotestsrc ! alsasink`

### Bluetooth not working
1. Ensure BlueZ is running: `systemctl status bluetooth`
2. Check adapter is powered: `bluetoothctl power on`
3. Verify PipeWire/PulseAudio Bluetooth modules are loaded

### Bluetooth device refresh errors
If you see errors like `module 'dbus' has no attribute 'UTF8String'`:
- This is fixed in the current version - the code now uses modern dbus-python APIs
- Ensure you have the latest version of `dbus-python` installed
- The code automatically handles dbus type conversions for compatibility

### Panel layout issues
Delete `~/.config/musicplayer/layout.json` to reset to default layout.
